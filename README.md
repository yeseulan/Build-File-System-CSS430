# Build-File-System-CSS430

Purpose
In this project, you will build a Unix-like file system on the ThreadOS. Through the use of the file system, user programs will now be able to access persistent data on disk by way of stream-oriented files rather than the more painful direct access to disk blocks with rawread() and rawrite().
